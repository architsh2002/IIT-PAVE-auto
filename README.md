# IITPAVE Batch Automation â€“ Pavement Stress-Strain Analysis Tool

This project automates the simulation of flexible pavement responses using the IITPAVE software. The program systematically generates multiple combinations of pavement parameters, executes simulations via IITPAVEâ€™s executable, extracts stress-strain results from the output file, and compiles the findings into a well-structured Excel workbook.

## Objective

Performing iterative pavement response analyses manually in IITPAVE is inefficient when evaluating numerous material and geometric combinations. This tool provides a way to:

- Auto-generate input files for multiple cases
- Batch-run IITPAVE simulations
- Parse output stress-strain data at two key depths
- Export results in a tabular Excel format for comparison and plotting

## How the Script Works

1. **Parameter Sweep**:  
   The code iterates over:
   - `mod_surf` (surface layer modulus),
   - `mod_base` (base layer modulus),
   - `thk_surf` (surface layer thickness)

2. **Input File Generation**:  
   For each combination, the script creates an `IITPAVE.in` file with layer properties and loading conditions.

3. **Execution of IITPAVE**:  
   The program automatically runs the IITPAVE analysis by invoking `IITPFILE.exe` using Python's `subprocess` module.

4. **Output Parsing**:  
   The output file `iitpave.out` is scanned using regular expressions. The script extracts:
   - Vertical stress (Ïƒz)
   - Tangential stress (Ïƒt)
   - Radial stress (Ïƒr)
   - Shear stress (Ï„)
   - Vertical strain (Îµz)
   - Tangential strain (Îµt)
   - Radial strain (Îµr)

   These are extracted at:
   - **Full depth of the surface layer (`z = h1`)**
   - **Half depth (`z = h1/2`)**

5. **Excel Compilation**:  
   Using the `openpyxl` library, results are recorded in an Excel workbook. A separate worksheet is created for each value of `mod_base`, storing results across all cases for easy filtering and visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Output

- **Excel file**: `IITPAVE_Results_Tabular.xlsx`  
  Contains all stress and strain values across simulations, categorized by base modulus.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3** â€“ scripting and automation
- **openpyxl** â€“ for Excel workbook generation
- **subprocess** â€“ to execute `.exe` files from within Python
- **re (regex)** â€“ to parse floating-point and scientific notation output from IITPAVE
- **IITPFILE.exe** â€“ pavement response calculator from the IITPAVE suite

## How to Run

Ensure the following files are present in the same directory:
- `IIT PAVE auto.py` (this Python script)
- `IITPFILE.exe` (IITPAVE executable)

Then run the script using the command line:

```bash
python "IIT PAVE auto.py"
